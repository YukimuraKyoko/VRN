## Details
- **Unity Version:** 2018.4.20f1
- **Important Assets:** VRCSDK3, UdonSharp (U#)
- **Purpose:** For a large VRChat Japanese/English learning Community
- **Duration of Project:** 1 week (so far), many more weeks planned
- **Project Description:** Creating a world for my VRChat discord server about learning Japanese/English. <br>
The main take from this project is using a large database (on a single script since Udon right now is limited) <br>
and using it to create flashcards, quizzes and other study material.

On top of study material I do plan to add other elements to the project such as a functioning town; functioning local-zone clock town that tells time, <br>
small versions of themed areas with a UI on the play to toggle JP/EN translations, (maybe) some npcs.  All in all I still have to keep watch of optimization <br>
since networking can be harsh and ownership on pick up can make things break.
